The chip is in the center or any side and connected to the outer environment.

#### Opening Up the Chip

### Example: RISC SoC

The word "foundry" is important in chip design.

A foundry is a factory that manufactures chips. It has machines used to manufacture the chip, e.g., **TSMC**, **GlobalFoundries**.

#### What is Intellectual Property (IP)?

IP refers to the intelligence and logic blocks within a chip.

#### Macros in Chip Design

Macros are digital logic blocks like SPI and RISC SoC that are pre-designed and used in building the chip.

### RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

RISC-V is a language of the computer, specifying the architecture and how it will be implemented in hardware.

#### Converting RISC-V Architecture to Layout

##### Architecture Implemented by RTL

### Understanding the Architecture

#### How Apps Instructions Are Understood by Hardware

The commands flow from system software to hardware. The key units involved are:
- OS
- Compiler
- Assembler

These components help the computer understand commands generated by applications.

#### Expanding the Architecture

### Part 1b - RTL

#### Key Tools for ASIC Design

- RTL IPs
- EDA Tools
- PDK Data

#### What is a PDK?

PDK stands for **Process Design Kit** and serves as the interface between the fab (fabrication facility) and designers.

##### Key Components of PDK:
- Process Design Rules: DRC, LVS, PEX
- Device Models
- Digital Standard Cell Libraries
- I/O Libraries

### Is 130nm Old?

Is 130nm still in use? Is it fast? Let's understand more.

### EDA Tools Overview

#### Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow

1. **Synthesis**  
2. **Floor/Power Planning**  
3. **Placement**  
4. **Clock Tree Synthesis**  
5. **Routing**  
6. **Signoff**

#### OpenLane

OpenLane is a framework for ASIC design based on industry standards.

##### Key Goals:
- Autonomous and interactive operation modes
- Design Space Exploration
- Regression Testing

### RTL Synthesis

#### Design Exploration in OpenLane

#### Post-Synthesis Steps

- **DFT** (Design for Test)
- **LEC** (Logic Equivalence Check) [Yosys]
- **RC Extraction**
- **STA** (Static Timing Analysis)
- **Physical Verification** (Magic & Netegon)

### Core and Die Dimensions

The core of a chip is the area where logical cells are placed.

#### Rectangular and Square Chips

- **Rectangular Chip:**
    - Example of layout
    - Dimensions calculation
- **Square Chip:**
    - Example of layout
    - Dimensions calculation

### Power Planning and Pin Placement

#### Logical Cell Placement and Blockage

#### Placement & Routing

- Bind netlist with physical cells
- Optimize placement for signal integrity using repeaters (buffers)

### Cell Design Flow

#### Timing Characterization

1. Propagation Delay
2. Transition Time

#### Spice Deck and Waveform Analysis

- **Rise Delay:** Calculated by subtracting red line from green line
- **Fall Delay:** Same method as rise delay

### Mask CMOS Fabrication Process

- Photolithography
- Ion Implantation (e.g., Boron, Arsenic)

### Power-Aware CTS

- **Setup Timing Analysis**
- **Hold Timing Analysis**

In routing, adjacent grid boxes should be numbered for clarity.
